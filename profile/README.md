Welcome to ierisLabs, a passion project for open-source software. Started by
[ieris19](https://github.com/ieris19) in 2024, ierisLabs is home to a variety of
projects, including libraries, tools, and small applications.

## About

The goal of ierisLabs is to provide high-quality, well-documented software that
makes developers' lives easier. We strive to create projects that are easy to
understand, simple to use and implement.

Originally started as a library called `ierislib`, where many different projects
housed in a monorepo had wildly different purposes, code quality. ierisLabs is 
the next iteration of that idea, where each project receives more care and 
attention.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Feel free to open an issue or pull
request in any of our repositories. Any help is appreciated, whether it's fixing
a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation. If you're unsure where to
start, feel free to ask for guidance, and we'll help you get started.

## Open Source Commitment

All our projects are licensed under open-source licenses. Depending on the 
project, and specially its aims and dependencies, we choose the license we feel 
is most appropriate. You can find the license for each project in its repository.

## Roadmap

Currently, we're working on porting all the current projects, from ierisLib to
their own repositories under the ierisLabs organization. In the process, we're
bringing the code up to date, documenting it, and overall verifying the quality
of the code. 

We're also working on contact channels, such as an email address, a Discord
server and more! Stay tuned for more updates.

Thank you for visiting ierisLabs! We hope you find something useful here.
